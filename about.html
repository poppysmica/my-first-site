    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of creativity and technology. This journey into web development represents my first steps into the world of coding, guided by AI assistance and driven by curiosity. I believe in the power of "vibe coding" - letting intuition and creativity flow while building something meaningful. Every line of code is a new discovery, and every project is an opportunity to learn and grow.</p>
